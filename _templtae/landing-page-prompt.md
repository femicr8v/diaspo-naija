# ðŸ“„ Recreate Landing Page â€” Developer Prompt

## Objective

Recreate the landing page shown in the attached image using my preferred coding standards and tools.

## ðŸ”§ Key Guidelines

- Extract all **recurring static/dynamic content** (e.g., text blocks, button labels, image URLs) into a `constants.ts` file.
- Follow a **minimal, clean, and modular coding style** â€” keep each section/component readable and well-organized.
- Use **Framer Motion** for **smooth and subtle animations** that enhance user experience without being distracting.
- Integrate **ShadCN UI components** (e.g., buttons, cards, accordions) wherever suitable to ensure design consistency and reduce boilerplate.
- Maintain **flexibility in styling** â€” the goal is not just to replicate the image exactly, but to create a **beautiful, modern, and visually appealing landing page**.

## ðŸ’¡ Visual & UX Focus

- The design should be **aesthetically pleasing**, **intentional**, and feel **professionally crafted**.
- Feel free to **enhance or slightly reinterpret elements** if it improves usability or elevates the design.
- Make sure the layout is **fully responsive** across devices and screen sizes.

Let me know if youâ€™d like help scaffolding the file structure, building specific sections (like hero/testimonials/FAQ), or integrating your preferred fonts and color palette.
